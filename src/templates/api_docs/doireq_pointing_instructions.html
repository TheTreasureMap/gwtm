<p>This endpoint will validate:</p>
<ul>
    <li>whether the pointings have a status completed</li>
    <li>whether the pointings were submitted by the user associated with the api_token</li>
    <li>whether the pointings were taken for the same GW event. They must be associated with the same graceid</li>
</ul>
